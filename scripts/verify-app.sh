# Builds Wordflock for both platforms and proves it actually ran.
#
# Three failures this exists to prevent, each paid for once across the portfolio:
#   - `expo run:android` can fail in a second and leave the PREVIOUS APK
#     installed, so the app launches, renders, and proves nothing. Each build's
#     own exit code is checked.
#   - A killed emulator leaves AVD lock files and the next start refuses with
#     "Another emulator instance is running", which reads like a stray process.
#   - An emulator and an Xcode build together exhaust this machine, and the
#     symptom shows up on the NEXT app. The emulator is killed before Xcode runs.
#
# iOS used to end at "builds, installs, launches, renders", because Simulator.app
# is missing from this Xcode install and there is no window to click. That is no
# longer true: idb drives the simulator headlessly, including the ATT prompt,
# which had never been exercised anywhere in this portfolio until it did.
#   ../next-mobile-apps/scripts/idb-ui.py <udid> labels|find|tap
# Tap by accessibility LABEL, not coordinate — idb takes points, which differ
# between a phone and a 13" iPad, so a coordinate script needs rewriting per
# device and a label script does not. Android has the same interface in
# scripts/adb-ui.py.
